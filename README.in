Rate-limited autoresponder for qmail
Bruce Guenter <bruce@untroubled.org>
Version @VERSION@
@TODAY@

This is a simple program to automatically respond to emails.

It is based on some ideas (but little or no code) from a similar
autoresponder by Eric Huss <e-huss@netmeridian.com>, and ideas presented
in the qmail mailing list.

Features:
- Limits rate of automatic responses (defaults to a maximum of one
  message every hour).
- Will not respond to nearly every type of mailing list or bulk email.
- Will not respond to bounce messages or MAILER-DAEMON.
- Bounces looping messages.
- Can insert the original subject into the response.
- Can copy original message into response.
- Can use links in the rate-limiting data directory to limit inode usage
  to a single inode.
- Can limit responses to a certain date/time range.

Installation:

- Make sure the latest version of bglibs from
  http://untroubled.org/bglibs/ is compiled and installed.
- Build the sources by running "make".  To build the MySQL support, run
  "make mysql" as well.
- After the package has been compiled, run the following command as root:
	make install

Usage (file-based):

Put "|qmail-autoresponder DIRECTORY" into your ".qmail" file before
other delivery instructions.  DIRECTORY is the directory into which
rate-limiting information will be stored, and is expected to contain a
"message.txt" file containing a pre-formatted response (including
headers).  Any instance of "%S" in the message file will be replaced
with the original subject.

Usage (MySQL):

Put "|qmail-autoresponder-mysql USERNAME DOMAIN" into your ".qmail" file
before other delivery instructions.  All data (including the message)
will be pulled from the MySQL table.  See schema.mysql for a table
schema.  This program reads MySQL options from the "qmail-autoresponder"
group.  If $MYSQL_USER, $MYSQL_HOST, $MYSQL_PASS, $MYSQL_DB, or
$MYSQL_SOCK are set in the .qmail file, they override the defaults in
the MySQL configuration file.  The parameters "USERNAME" and "DOMAIN"
are used as keys into the MySQL tables.  DOMAIN may be replaced with
"$HOST", and USERNAME may be replaced with "$EXT", "$DEFAULT" or "$USER"
depending on the installation (quoting is required).
